It all started when I was walking to class one morning. It was a tuesday, from what I remember, pretty cold. I forgot my thick, winter gloves and only had my pockets to keep me warm. About halfway down langdon, I notice a weird sight, the sky was purple! For a moment I thought I was perhaps dreaming or seeing things but that wasn't the case. Everyone around me was also confused on the color of the sky. But, like any college student, we carried on with our day until about 4:37 in the afternoon when 'it' happened. 

(Parker Von Haden) I was confused at first, as was everyone else. Nobody has ever seen anything like it before. I looked up at the sun and there was a circular shaped object covering the sun causing the sky to appear purple as if the sun was setting. Next thing I knew, this object was getting larger and larger. Everyone started to panic as it was about to crash down onto campus. Luckily it crashed at the top of Bascom hill and slid its way down and onto state street. Everyone was crowding this UFO like object that landed right outside the university book store. The doors opened and lots of mystical smoke crept out the crevasses when chancellor Rebecca Blank took a step out and stated, "I have found the cure to COVID-19".
