It all started when I was walking to class one morning. It was a tuesday, from what I remember, pretty cold. I forgot my thick, winter gloves and only had my pockets to keep me warm. About halfway down langdon, I notice a weird sight, the sky was purple! For a moment I thought I was perhaps dreaming or seeing things but that wasn't the case. Everyone around me was also confused on the color of the sky. But, like any college student, we carried on with our day until about 4:37 in the afternoon when 'it' happened.
